# Clustering
This project aims at clustering flowers using iris dataset, and tested how good a model can predict the flower's species based on the clusters made.

The procedures are being carried out as shown below:
- Imported data
- Explored Data Analysis (we found out that setosa should be easily recognized due to it being exclusively small, and that there will be bias between versicolor and virginica)
- Performed unsupervised clustering
- Separate data into train and test dataset
- Conducted feature scaling
- Fitted data into 4 kinds of model: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine
- Compared accuracy, learning curve, and classification report between models
